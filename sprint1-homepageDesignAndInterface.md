2. **Game Recommendation** – Randomly return a list of game cards as suggestions.  
3. **Team Search** – Search for teams associated with a specific game and return a list of team cards.

Below is an overview of the layout, followed by the interface and API details for each feature.

## 1. Layout Overview

- **Header**
  - A **Search Bar** where users can type in a query. There may be a button or dropdown to select searching for either a “Game” or a “Team.”  
  - **My Profile** and **Logout** buttons in the top-right corner.

- **Main Content**
  - **Game Cards**: Display game name, thumbnail or picture, and a short description.  
  - **Team Cards**: Display team information like team name, members, and a brief description related to the selected game.  
  - **Game Info or Team Info Sections**: Clicking on a card can open or redirect to a more detailed page.

- **Random Recommendations**
  - A random list of games is displayed automatically (like a “Recommended for You” section) if no specific search is initiated.

- **Scroll Section**  
  - A scrollable area for displaying additional games or teams.

## 2. Game Search

### Purpose
Allow users to search for games by name and retrieve an array of game cards showing key information about each game.

### Potential Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/games/search
```

query is the keyword or phrase to search for:

```json
{
  "query": "Game A"
}
```

### Response Example

For images, Thumbnails are typically lower resolution and smaller in file size. This reduces load time.

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Search successful",
  "data": [
    {
      "gameId": "123",
      "name": "Game A",
      "description": "Description",
      "thumbnailUrl": "https://example.jpg" 
    },
    {
      "gameId": "456",
      "name": "Game B",
      "description": "Description",
      "thumbnailUrl": "https://example.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Game Recommendations

### Purpose

Display random or personalized recommended games on the homepage. These can be shown on initial load (when a user first visits the homepage) or as a separate endpoint.

### Potential Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/games/recommendations
```

### Request Example

No specific request body is required if recommendations are generated by the system automatically. A user token or session might be used for personalized suggestions.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Recommendations fetched",
  "data": [
    {
      "gameId": "123",
      "name": "Game A",
      "description": "Description",
      "thumbnailUrl": "https://example.jpg"
    },
    {
      "gameId": "456",
      "name": "Game B",
      "description": "Description",
      "thumbnailUrl": "https://example.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Team Search

### Purpose
Enable users to search for teams related to a specific game. This typically occurs after a game search or from the homepage toggle that allows search by “Team” instead of “Game.”

### Potential Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/teams/search
```

### Request Example

```bash
{
  "gameName": "Game A"
}
```

### Response Example

An array of team objects for the searched game, each showing host, members, and a brief description of the team.

```bash
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "Team search successful",
  "data": [
    {
      "teamId": "123",
      "teamName": "Team A",
      "host": "playerOne",
      "members": ["playerTwo", "playerThree", "playerFour", "playerFive"],
      "description": "Discription",
      "gameName": "Game A"
    },
    {
      "teamId": "456",
      "teamName": "Team B",
      "host": "playerSix",
      "members": ["playerSeven", "playerEight"],
      "description": "Description",
      "gameName": "Game A"
    }
  ]
}
```
